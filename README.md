# PhotoEditor

***IMPORTANT***
If you use save before you start a new session or new photos will override the old ones
Also the code is located in the master branch

My project name is a Photo Editor. My team name is Me and I. I have decided to work alone on this project.'

I am trying to build a photo editor that has a few different options to edit a photo. I plan to include color changes, mirroring, and a fun one to make the picture funny. I may possibly add more as I get working on it but I am not entirely sure of other things to do at the moment.


Im not sure how to upload a photo to a read me so this takes you to my UML diagram.

This project will probably take a lot of effort as I'm doing it on my own. I'm excited to work on it though because its really going to test my current knowledge.
