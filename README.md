# PhotoEditor

***IMPORTANT***
If you use save before you start a new session or new photos will override the old ones
Also the code is located in the master branch

To use the program select load photo. Once a photo is loaded you can change the color profile or the brightness of the photo, due to constarints you can only choose one color profile. As well you can rotate the photos or mirror them as you wish, however each rotation will reset to the original position to not cause confusion. An undo button is included to reset the photo incase you dont like the results of your changes. Once done you can save as many photos as you wish with the save button. If you download the code make sure to change the directory of the saves to your own personal folder.

My project name is a Photo Editor. My team name is Me and I. I have decided to work alone on this project.'

I am trying to build a photo editor that has a few different options to edit a photo. I plan to include color changes, mirroring, and a fun one to make the picture funny. I may possibly add more as I get working on it but I am not entirely sure of other things to do at the moment.


Im not sure how to upload a photo to a read me so this takes you to my UML diagram.

This project will probably take a lot of effort as I'm doing it on my own. I'm excited to work on it though because its really going to test my current knowledge.
